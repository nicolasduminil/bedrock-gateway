Meeting transcript:
Michel: Hi Benoit, I want to discuss the workstream  for our new product launch
Benoit: Sure Michel, is there anything in particular you want to discuss?
Michel: Yes, I want to talk about how users enter into the product.
Benoit: Ok, in that case let me add in Nicolas.
Nicolas: Hey everyone
Benoit: Hi Nicolas, Michel wants to discuss how users enter into the product.
Michel: its too complicated and we should remove friction.  for example, why do I need to fill out additional forms?  I also find it difficult to find where to access the product when I first land on the landing page.
Benoit: I would also add that I think there are too many steps.
Nicolas: Ok, I can work on the landing page to make the product more discoverable but Benoit can you work on the additonal forms?
Benoit: Yes but I would need to work with James from another team as he needs to unblock the sign up workflow.  Michel can you document any other concerns so that I can discuss with James only once?
Michel: Sure.
